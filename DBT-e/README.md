Of course. Here is a complete, professional README.md file for your project.
This README frames the project as an educational tool for studying web application architecture and security, as per your learning objectives.
Vulnerable Flask Application (VFA)
An intentionally vulnerable but architecturally robust Flask web application designed for educational purposes. This project helps developers and security enthusiasts understand common web vulnerabilities in the context of a professionally structured application.
ðŸš¨ DISCLAIMER: This is an educational tool. DO NOT deploy this application in a production environment or use it for any malicious activities. It is intentionally designed with security vulnerabilities for learning and practice.
## Features
This application simulates a data collection portal and includes a rich set of technical and "vulnerable" features for study.
### Technical Features
 * Modern Web Framework: Built with Flask using the Application Factory pattern.
 * Database Integration: Uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to persist all submissions in an SQLite database.
 * Asynchronous Background Tasks: Integrates Celery and Redis to offload slow tasks (like sending notifications), ensuring a responsive UI.
 * Professional Logging: Sends notifications for new submissions to Discord and Telegram from a background worker.
 * Deployment Ready: Includes configuration files (Procfile, runtime.txt) for deployment on platforms like Railway or Heroku.
### Learning & Security Features
 * Vulnerable-by-Design: Intentionally lacks server-side input validation and CSRF protection.
 * Data Exposure: Demonstrates sensitive data handling and logging patterns.
 * Educational Playground: Perfect for practicing penetration testing techniques in a safe, legal environment.
## Architecture Overview
This project is built using a professional, scalable structure to demonstrate best practices in application design (while intentionally omitting security practices for learning).

## Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the application running locally.
### 1. Prerequisites
 * Python 3.11+
 * Redis Server (for Celery)
 * Git
### 2. Clone & Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd DBT-e

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Configuration
 * Open config.py.
 * Fill in your actual DISCORD_WEBHOOK, TELEGRAM_TOKEN, and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.
### 4. Initialize the Database
Before running the app for the first time, you need to create the database file and tables.
# Set the Flask app environment variable
export FLASK_APP="main:create_app()"

# Run the database migration/creation command
flask db init  # Run only once to create the migrations folder
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade # Creates the database and tables

### 5. Running the Application
You need to run three processes in separate terminal windows: the Redis server, the Celery worker, and the Flask web app.
Terminal 1: Start Redis
# This command depends on your OS (e.g., Homebrew on macOS)
redis-server

Terminal 2: Start the Celery Worker
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
celery -A tasks.celery worker --loglevel=info

Terminal 3: Start the Flask App
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
# Gunicorn is recommended for a production-like environment
gunicorn 'main:create_app()'

Your application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
## Learning Objectives
Use this application to practice:
 * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Try submitting <script>alert('XSS')</script> in the form fields.
 * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Since there are no CSRF tokens, can you craft an external HTML page that submits the form on a user's behalf?
 * Data Analysis: Use an SQLite browser to inspect the submissions.db file and see exactly what data is being stored.
 * Code Review: Analyze main.py and other files to identify architectural patterns and security anti-patterns.
